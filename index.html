                    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
                    <p>Mirzakhani was born on 12 May 1977 in Tehran, Iran. As a child, she attended Tehran Farzanegan School, part of the National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET).
                         In her junior and senior year of high school, she won the gold medal for mathematics in the Iranian National Olympiad, thus allowing her to bypass the national college entrance exams.
                           In 1994, Mirzakhani became the first Iranian female to win a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad in Hong Kong, scoring 41 out of 42 points.The following year, in Toronto,
                           she became the first Iranian to achieve a perfect score and to win two gold medals in the International Mathematical Olympiad. Later in her life, she collaborated with friend, colleague, 
                           and Olympiad silver medalist, Roya Beheshti Zavareh, on their book Elementary Number Theory, Challenging Problems which was published in 1999. 
                           Mirzakhani and Zavareh together were the first women to compete in the Iranian National Mathematical Olympiad and won gold and silver medals respectively in 1995.

                           On 17 March 1998, after attending a conference consisting of gifted individuals and former Olympiad competitors, Mirzakhani and Zavareh, along with other attendees boarded a bus in Ahvaz en route to Tehran.
                           The bus was involved in an accident wherein it fell off a cliff, killing seven of the passengers—all Sharif University students. This incident is widely considered to be a national tragedy in Iran.
                           Mirzakhani and Zavareh were two of the few survivors.
                        
                           In 1999, she obtained a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from the Sharif University of Technology. During her time there, she received recognition from the American Mathematical Society for her work in developing a simple proof for a theorem of Schur.
                           She then went to the United States for graduate work, earning a PhD in 2004 from Harvard University, where she worked under the supervision of the Fields Medalist Curtis .Mirzakhani was a 2004 research fellow of the Clay Mathematics Institute and a professor at Princeton University.
                            In 2009, she became a professor at Stanford University.
